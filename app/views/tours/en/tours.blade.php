        capacity of ten passengers. Boat operators are approved-approved guides who are trained in the use of the
        onboard ship-to-shore radio and adhere to strict time schedules. All boats have safety gear and all passengers
        wear obligatory life vests. The 4-hour excursions depart daily from late December through early April and are
        cancelled only due to unsafe weather or by approved order.</p>

        aII tours are conducted in a safe and practical manner. Passengers shouid be
        aware that inherent risks do exist when visiting a natural park in its primitive Iife
        form.</p>
